WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. It is a compatiblity layer developed by Microsoft that allows running native Linux command-line tools and utilites directly on Windows. WSL provides a way to run a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, alongside the Windows operating system without the need for virtual machines or dual-boot configurations.

WSL 1 is based on a compatibility layer that translates Linux system calls to Windows equivalents, while WSL 2 is a more advanced version that utilizes a lightweight virtual machine for improved performance and compatibility.

These requirements must be met then only one must proceed with the installation. Requirements To install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows, you‚Äôll need to meet the following requirements: Operating System: Windows 10, version 1903 or later. Note: WSL 2 is available in Windows 10, version 2004 or later. System Architecture: 64-bit Windows. Enable Virtualization: Ensure that virtualization is enabled in your system‚Äôs BIOS settings. Some systems may refer to this feature as ‚ÄúIntel Virtualization Technology‚Äù (Intel VT) or ‚ÄúAMD Virtualization‚Äù (AMD-V). Windows Update: Make sure your Windows system is up to date. WSL requires certain Windows updates to function correctly, so it‚Äôs recommended to have the latest updates installed. Check WSL Support: Verify that your Windows version supports WSL. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the command: wsl --list --online . If the command displays a list of available WSL distributions, your Windows version supports WSL. Internet Connection: Ensure you have an active internet connection during the installation process. WSL will download the Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store during the installation. Sufficient Disk Space: Make sure you have enough free disk space to install the Linux distribution. The disk space requirements vary depending on the Linux distribution you choose. Keep in mind that these requirements are based on the general guidelines for WSL installation. Microsoft may introduce updates or changes, so it‚Äôs always a good idea to refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information regarding WSL installation requirements for your specific Windows version. If these requirements are fulfilled then we can proceed with the installation. Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature: Open PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Start button and selecting ‚ÄúWindows PowerShell (Admin)‚Äù. Run the following command: wsl --install or wsl --install -d \u003cdistribution\u003e (replace \u003cdistribution\u003e with the name of the Linux distribution you want to install, such as ‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù). This command will enable WSL and install the default Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. Install Command Follow any on-screen prompts and wait for the installation to complete. Restart the computer! Upgrading WSL to version 2 WSL 2 is better than WSL because it utilizes a full Linux kernel within a lightweight virtual machine (VM), resulting in superior performance, improved system call compatibility, and enhanced resource utilization. The inclusion of the Linux kernel allows for faster file system operations, seamless integration of Linux applications with Windows, and an overall more powerful and efficient Linux experience on Windows machines. So, we will be upgrading to wsl 2. First of all, you must have installed WSL from the steps above. This is really important Then, you should download the latest Linux Kernal update package and install it Finally, you should set WSL2 as your default version. Open Powershell as Administrator and run: wsl --set-default-version 2 Install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store: Open the Microsoft Store app on your Windows system. Search for the Linux distribution you want to install, such as ‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù or ‚ÄúDebian‚Äù. In this installation we are installing ‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù so, I‚Äôll be installing ubuntu. You can also use winget install ubuntu if it is convinient. From the search results click on Ubuntu and on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button Wait for the installation to complete. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection speed. Ubuntu Installation Set up your Linux distribution: Launch the installed Linux distribution from the Start menu or by searching for its name. The first time you launch it, you‚Äôll need to wait for the installation to complete, which involves setting up the initial Linux user account and configu","date":"2023-06-19","objectID":"/ubuntuwsl/:1:2","tags":["Blog","how-to-do","linux"],"title":"Windows Gets a Linux Makeover: Install Ubuntu WSL Today!","uri":"/ubuntuwsl/"},{"categories":null,"content":"About Suyog Prasai","date":"2023-06-16","objectID":"/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":" üëã I am a passionate programmer with expertise in Python, specializing in web development, data analysis, and automation. üíª With a commitment to clean and elegant code, I continuously explore new technologies and stay updated with the latest trends to deliver high-quality solutions.
