APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a package management system used in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. It simplifies software installation, upgrades, and removals. APT uses repositories, which are online servers containing a collection of software packages. It automatically handles dependencies, fetching and installing additional packages required by the software. APT keeps track of installed packages and provides updates for bug fixes, security patches, and new features. With APT, users can easily discover, install, and update software packages.

They are online servers that contain a vast collection of software packages. Understanding repositories is key to accessing and managing software through APT (Advanced Package Tool). In Ubuntu, there are several types of repositories: Main: This repository contains officially supported and fully open-source software packages. It is enabled by default and provides a wide range of applications that are thoroughly tested and maintained by the Ubuntu team. Universe: The universe repository consists of community-maintained packages that are not officially supported by Ubuntu. These packages expand the software availability and are typically open-source. Restricted: The restricted repository contains proprietary software packages that are supported by Ubuntu but have certain usage restrictions due to licensing or legal constraints. These packages may require additional steps for installation. Multiverse: The multiverse repository includes packages that are not open-source and have restrictive licenses. These packages are not officially supported and may have compatibility or legal issues. Enabling and managing repositories in Ubuntu can be done through various methods. Here are a couple of common approaches: Using apt-add-repository command: The apt-add-repository command allows you to enable additional repositories. For example, to add a repository, you can use the following command: sudo apt-add-repository universe This command enables the universe repository. After adding the repository, you will need to update the package lists using apt-get update. Editing configuration files: Repositories can also be managed by editing the /etc/apt/sources.list file or the files in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory. These files list the repositories enabled on your system. By adding or removing repository entries, you can control the software sources available through APT. Remember to exercise caution when adding or removing repositories. Stick to trusted sources and official repositories to ensure the integrity and security of your system. Understanding repositories and how to enable or manage them gives you greater control over the software packages available for installation in Ubuntu.

These requirements must be met then only one must proceed with the installation. Requirements To install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows, you’ll need to meet the following requirements: Operating System: Windows 10, version 1903 or later. Note: WSL 2 is available in Windows 10, version 2004 or later. System Architecture: 64-bit Windows. Enable Virtualization: Ensure that virtualization is enabled in your system’s BIOS settings. Some systems may refer to this feature as “Intel Virtualization Technology” (Intel VT) or “AMD Virtualization” (AMD-V). Windows Update: Make sure your Windows system is up to date. WSL requires certain Windows updates to function correctly, so it’s recommended to have the latest updates installed. Check WSL Support: Verify that your Windows version supports WSL. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the command: wsl --list --online . If the command displays a list of available WSL distributions, your Windows version supports WSL. Internet Connection: Ensure you have an active internet connection during the installation process. WSL will download the Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store during the installation. Sufficient Disk Space: Make sure you have enough free disk space to install the Linux distribution. The disk space requirements vary depending on the Linux distribution you choose. Keep in mind that these requirements are based on the general guidelines for WSL installation. Microsoft may introduce updates or changes, so it’s always a good idea to refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information regarding WSL installation requirements for your specific Windows version. If these requirements are fulfilled then we can proceed with the installation. Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature: Open PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Start button and selecting “Windows PowerShell (Admin)”. Run the following command: wsl --install or wsl --install -d \u003cdistribution\u003e (replace \u003cdistribution\u003e with the name of the Linux distribution you want to install, such as “Ubuntu”). This command will enable WSL and install the default Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. Install Command Follow any on-screen prompts and wait for the installation to complete. Restart the computer! Upgrading WSL to version 2 WSL 2 is better than WSL because it utilizes a full Linux kernel within a lightweight virtual machine (VM), resulting in superior performance, improved system call compatibility, and enhanced resource utilization. The inclusion of the Linux kernel allows for faster file system operations, seamless integration of Linux applications with Windows, and an overall more powerful and efficient Linux experience on Windows machines. So, we will be upgrading to wsl 2. First of all, you must have installed WSL from the steps above. This is really important Then, you should download the latest Linux Kernal update package and install it Finally, you should set WSL2 as your default version. Open Powershell as Administrator and run: wsl --set-default-version 2 Install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store: Open the Microsoft Store app on your Windows system. Search for the Linux distribution you want to install, such as “Ubuntu” or “Debian”. In this installation we are installing “Ubuntu” so, I’ll be installing ubuntu. You can also use winget install ubuntu if it is convinient. From the search results click on Ubuntu and on the “Install” button Wait for the installation to complete. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection speed.
